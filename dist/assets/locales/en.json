For example, if one were to create a namespace called “foo” that namespace cannot be created by a second person. Just like on the internet, a domain can have a sub-domain, namespaces can have sub-namespaces. And it is possible to create multiple sub-namespaces with the same name (example: “foo.bar” and “foo2.bar”, “bar” is the sub-namespace/sub-domain).  Namespaces can have up to 3 levels, a namespace and its two levels of sub-namespace domains.\r\n",

 "lightwallet": "NEM has three versions of wallets that can be run locally and independently of an NIS. The NCC is the first wallet and comes equipped with APIs. Open-source Android and iOS mobile apps have been built and are released on the testnet for full testing and will be coming to the App Store and the Google Play store soon. And lastly there is the new lightwallet. ",
 "lightWallet": "What is Lightwallet?",
 "lightwallet2": "NEM’s lightwallet is a fully equipped wallet but in the form of a browser webpage and written in javascript that, like all NEM wallets, does all important signing locally. So now one can have just one html file to send XEM in a public network using any NIS without risking the safety of the account. Every NIS serves the lightwallet via port 7777 but if connecting to any node other than a trusted one, it is recommended to run a standalone lightwallet version for full security. ",
 "lightwallet3": "The <a href=\"http://blog.nem.io/lightwallet/\">lightwallet</a> is important because it enables any merchant to easily incorporate the lightwallet javascript code into their websites to facilitate payments. This can be done in minutes and the implications can be profound as the NEM blockchain data become easily available and accessible by the merchant.\n\n",
 "lightWalletContent": "NEM has recently introduced a new type of wallet: the lightwallet. It allows users to make transactions just like what one can do with the NCC, but it uses a browser webpage written in javascript. So, now one can have just one html file to send XEM in a public network using any NIS without risking the safety of the account.\n\n",
 "lightWalletContent2": "Through the NIS web server, the NIS is essentially acting as a lightwallet service provider. While a trusted NIS can be accessed via a web browser without any additional add-ins or programs running, the most secure way to use the lightwallet is to run it locally on any device that supports js/html. To do this the all new lightwallet has been released as a stand alone version without the need to boot up a NIS.",

Mosaics can be applied with a levy so that any mosaic being sent on the network will have to have a special fee paid above the normal transactions fees.

 "multiAccounts": "What are Multisig Accounts, and how does that work?",
 "multiAccountsContent": "NEM's multisig was planned out carefully and is a contract on the chain.",
 "multiAccountsContent3": "NEM’s multisig is true M of N, meaning any number of signers less than or equal to N maybe be set up in the contract.",
 "multiAccountsContent4": "In NEM there are parent accounts and a child account. When you make a multisig account in NEM, you are making a parent account have control and power over a child account. You may also edit this contract at any time adding or removing signers. You can even remove the contract and turn the child account into a regular account again.",
 "multiAccountsContent5": "The NEM network sends notifications to users when they need to sign a transaction.  ",
 "multiAccountsContent6": "In addition to using NEM’s multisig as a way to protect funds, split signing power over accounts, share accounts, or create a 2FA, NEM’s multisig can be used as the foundation for distributed autonomous organizations.  ",
 "multiAccountsContent7": "For more information about NEM’s multisig, please go <a href=\"http://blog.nem.io/how-to-use-multi-signature-accounts/\">HERE</a>.",
 "multisig": "<a href=\"http://blog.nem.io/how-to-use-multi-signature-accounts/\">NEM's multisig solution</a> is the first “on blockchain”. This doesn’t sound like a big deal at first, but if one really takes a closer look at it, the advantages are significant. With other platforms, multisig has always been client or wallet based which means each implementation is not compatible across many different platforms, even if it is of the same crypto currency. NEM’s multisig can work with APIs and any wallet or app connecting to the NEM chain. This even enables blockchain pushed notifications announcing transactions to the wallets to sign. ",
 "multisig2": "NEM’s version of multisig doesn’t make new accounts for a multisig address by combining keys, instead it makes a contract that assigns rights and powers of a certain account to other accounts. This form of multi-user accounts can make any form of M of N with ease and can also have the M or the N edited just as easily by simply just updating the contract on the blockchain. And since the NEM’s multisig contracts can be edited as many times as a person likes, either adding or subtracting people as needed, it is not only good for securing funds, but also makes for a good foundation for DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organization).",
 "multisigTitle": "Multisig Contracts",
 "namespace": "<a href=\"http://blog.nem.io/mosaics-and-namespaces-2/\">Namespaces</a> on the NEM system is a domain naming system, not unlike that of the internet. There are higher level domains and subdomains. This allows one person with one domain to create many different subdomains for their different projects or outside business accounts. It also helps to build and maintain a reputation system for Mosaics.",
 "namespace2": "A creator owning the root domain namespace can create as many sub-domains as wanted using a convention similar to the Java namespace convention, i.e., separated by a dot \\\".\\\" to represent a domain or subdomain and a colon \\\":\\\" to represent the name of an asset. This gives the creator a practically limitless number of mosaics that can be defined within a practically limitless number of sub-domains.\n",
 "namespace3": "The sub-levels of a namespace can act as the actual name of the asset, or in some cases can be a class of assets as it is itself a sub-domain with lots of assets under that sub-domain name.

 "whatsPoi": "What is this \"POI\"?\r\n",
 "whatsPoiContent": "POI is short for \"Proof-of-Importance\". It is a consensus algorithm at the core of the NEM software. The higher your importance, the higher your chance to be allowed to calculate a block (and harvest the fees inside that block). POI adjusts your importance depending on how many transactions you make, with whom you make them and a number of other factors. If you don't do any transactions POI will set your importance based on your balance only (it is then similar to proof-of-stake).\n",
